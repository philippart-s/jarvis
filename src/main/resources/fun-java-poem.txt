In a land where the sun does not set,
Lived a band of Java developers, sweat.
With IDEs open, and fingers on keys,
They wrote code, all day, under the sun's sneezes.

Java Jim from the valley of Void,
With a beard full of coffee and pride.
His life motto: Compile, Run and Rejoice,
When bugs gave him the right musical voice.

Java Jane from the hills of Logic,
With a smile that could make any topic,
Fun-derful, her laugh was contagious delight,
Coding through the night, into the bright light.

Java Jack from the shores of Main,
Always wore a red hat and seemed disdain,
To all bugs that tried, he'd say with a grin,
"You're bugging out! Squash me, not them!"

Java Jill from the caverns of Debug,
With a roar as loud as her debugging bug,
She'd find those quiet errors in peace,
Then defeat them with noblest of ease!

One fine day at their Java villa,
They decided to write a jolly quilla,
A poem that baked chuckles and guffaws,
Creating waves that swelled the Java cause.

"JavaJe sai, JavaJim and JavaJay!
Together we've Charlied, come what may!
No bug, no error, no compiler's tantrum,
Can halt the progress or dampen ourrumor!"

So, write on, oh Java jokers, and laugh,
Let your mirth float above every after-wraft!
Coding, and laughter, a jolly Java verse,
We Java developers are on the infinite and light-hearted curriculum!
